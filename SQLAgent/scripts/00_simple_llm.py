Simple Agent Demo - Agent Framework Without Tools

This script demonstrates the most basic usage of LangChain's agent framework
without any tools. It creates an agent that can only talk to the LLM for
conversational AI, showing the agent structure before adding tool capabilities.

Educational Purpose:
- Understand the agent framework structure without tool complexity
- See how agents work at their core (just LLM conversation)
- Learn the foundation before adding SQL tools and capabilities
- Compare agent vs direct LLM usage

Key Concepts:
- Agent framework with zero tools
- Conversational agent pattern
- Agent initialization and invocation
- System message configuration for agents
